**Why do i need that?**
Imagine that you have something to hide in your notes. Well, you're lucky, because you have protected note ;D

**Warning**: this plugin only block the user from access the notes via obsidian, but since all notes are always locally stored on the users device, accessing them via the local file system will still work.
