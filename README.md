## Set password 🔑

- go to settings > community plugins > protected note and enable password.
- set any password you want on the modal.

## Encrypt and Decrypt 💾

- now you can encrypt all .md files.
- make sure that you have backed up your files before enabling encryption.
- when you exit obsidian, all files won't be encrypted. This happens because obsidian doesn't allow to start the encryption function when you're closing obsidian (_if you know how to encrypt files when you're leaving obsidian help me with code_).
- if you want to encrypt all your files when you leave you can use the ribbon icon.
- encryption was tested on Android and Windows. Be careful if you want to use it on other operating system.
